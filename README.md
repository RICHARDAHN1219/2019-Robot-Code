A fork from the official Sonic Squirrels robot code for me to view my old work

# 2019-Robot-Code

There are several WPILib robot project homed in this repository. When trying to build one of them in VS Code, make sure to open only the directory for the robot you want to build. Otherwise, VS Code gets confused.

## Practice Bot

This is the 2019 **Competition** bot.

## CompBot-Updated

This is a version of the 2019 Competition bot that has been ported to the 2020 WPILib libraries. Some parts of the robot have been disabled or updated to use this bot as a practice bot. The climbing stilts have been disabled.
